## Topics covered in building this Drum Kit Sample project are

### 1. Event Listeners:
    
document.addEventListener("keydown", function(event){

Here, If you see this event listener which we used in our JS code, for recognizing the key press through keyboard.
Let's quicky break this, once event listener checks through the whole document, keydown here rocognizes the respective key press on keyboard, and once that is found, we perform necessary action later once key press is triggered, that's how this above line works.

### 2. Explored the concept of how to play sounds on a website.
### 3. Explored and got deeper understanding on Javascript objects, Constructor functions, Initializing objects and methods.
### 4. I understand how we can add functions as parameters, and how we could use functions as callbacks.
### 5. Higher order function:

Learnt about higher order function, which means the functions, that's able to take functions as inputs.

### 6. Call back function:
These are the functions that are passed as inputs. Which is actually called as callback functions because it allows us to wait for something to finish.

### 7. Adding animations to websites.

### 8. Timeout function:

Understood something called "timeout function", used in situation where when we are trying to create a shadow on drums clicked, those earlier clicked drums click shadow was not coming back to its normal state, its still in shadow, we don't want that. So that by assigning a small delay of say 2 or 4 seconds something, it needs to come back normally, for which we use Time out function in javascript.
